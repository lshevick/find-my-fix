# Find My Fix
**An Automotive Shop Finder**

This app is here to help people easily find auto shops that can service their specific needs. They can save their cars to an account and use the infomation on that car to narrow down their search. The search results can be based off of what car they choose to search by. They can see what shops have to offer at a quick glance. This app is unique in that it enables users to write reviews for specific work that a shop has done on their cars. This helps people find exactly what they are looking for, wether it be custom modifications or a simple oil change. This app also can store past work in the records section, which helps users keep track of when they had their cars serviced.

This app was made with Django REST Framework and React. It uses Tailwindcss and daisyui for the front end styling, and google's geocoding and distance matrix apis.
